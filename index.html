            I have huge experience in testing in EPAM (for 7+ years) on big and challenging projects.
            I was responsible for several important initiatives as a Lead of initiative. It was challenging initiatives - many new tools were needed to learn such as COSMOS DB, ArgoCd, Kafka, for some topics we didn’t have real apps for testing, so we set up required request and response in Wire Mock to emulate work of 3rd party systems, also we have a lot of communication with teams from Downstream systems and integration testing with them.
            I have high level of technical skills, especially in automated Testing Tools and Frameworks. I run/analyze results/write automated tests in Soap UI, Vividus, writing BDD test cases in Gherkin and Karate.
            I also have experience in support team where we investigated incoming issues. Sometimes the issues had Blocker and Critical priority, they were required fast analysis and response, so I have experience working under pressure of time. 
            I participated in SFT Lab as a mentor, it indicates that I am always ready to share my knowledge.
